Test file

This is a file to test xsearch, which currently has the following 9 implementations:

1. cssearch for C#
2. fssearch for F#
3. gosearch for Go
4. hssearch for Haskell
5. javasearch for Java
6. nodesearch for Node.js (JavaScript)
7. pysearch.py for Python
8. rbsearch.rb for Ruby
9. scalasearch for Scala


The basic code structure includes these elements:

* SearchOptions - transforms option data in XML into the usage text, also builds
  a SearchSettings instance from command line arguments
* SearchSettings - encapsulates the search settings, including what directories
  or files to include/exclude, search patterns, lines before or after, etc.
* Searcher - executes the file search based on the SearchSettings
* FileUtil - helps determine file type (e.g. binary vs. text), searchability,
  etc.
* SearchResult - encapsulates a single search result


Future implementations will likely include:

* cljsearch for Clojure


Other possible implementations:

* clsearch for Common Lisp
* erlsearch for Erlang
* mlsearch for OCaml
* phpsearch for PHP
* plsearch for Perl
* rssearch for Rust


This is the second-to-last line of the test file. The final line is blank.
